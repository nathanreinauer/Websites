				Hi! I'm a web/software developer in Portland, OR. I have some cats and dogs. I also have a girlfriend and we have an adorable son named Paxton. My favorite movie is "The Truman Show" and I really like science. My favorite bands are The Beatles and Jellyfish. I have no tattoos. I can eat lots of sopapillas at a time. My dad may have played a small part in the formation of Pearl Jam. I think Calvin & Hobbes is the greatest. That picture to the left was taken in Colorado. The background of this div is rgba(48,48,48,.65). Whales evolved from animals that lived on land first.

				Hi! I'm the president of Pennsylvania. I have a large collection of novelty glasses in a hidden compartment of my car, always at the ready. Did I say car? I meant UFO. That's right, I travel in a flying object that no one can identify. I'm still trying to figure out what it is. My brother's name is Titanica and my sister is a gooseberry bush. I have three pets: A shark, a lark, and a man named Clark. I once gave a standing ovation that was so powerful, it recieved a leaping ovation. My best friend is an actor named Tobey Maguire, and sometimes we eat silly hats.
