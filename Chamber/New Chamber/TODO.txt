- Can you change the colors of the site to match the colors of the logo? We would like the logo to stay up on the page the whole time. And as we have moved to a more modern logo, we are looking at a little less tradition look (the older photos) I'm also thinking that if we have a slideshow of pictures maybe the still ones on the side are to much.

- Can you make the pictures smaller so that you can see the whole image...words or pictures are cut off.

- On the logo picture can you make the background color something other than White?

- Take the phone number off and just use the gmail address...we don't have a phone. Also we do not have a physical address either--at the top you've got the Connell Chamber of Commerce...I don't know that it is necessary since it is on the logo.

- Love the wheat, for new members!!! 
But not a fan of the upcoming events one...Looking for something more modern.

- As far as pictures go...do you have access to others (not a big fan of the cigar smoker)
